# gestOSCSender
An Open Sound Control (OSC) server written in C++ to connect GestureTek's GestTrack3D SDK to OSC-enabled applications.

As a proof of concept, I have developed Gestdrums, an experiment in gesture-controlled drums made with Processing that uses GestTrack3D through gestOSCSender. Watch a video about Gestdrums [here](https://youtu.be/qLQKYlK8aWg).
